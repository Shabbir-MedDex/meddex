## About this Website

MedDex is a free, online dictionary of medical abbreviations. Search hundreds of medical
abbreviations, acronyms, shorthands and more!

We aim to simplify the complex world of medical abbreviations by providing a centralised
platform for accessing medical abbreviations, ensuring clarity and accuracy in medical communication.

Our vision is to empower healthcare professionals, students and enthusiasts with instant access to a
vast database of medical abbreviations, enhancing efficiency and patient care outcomes.

We created MedDex in April 2024 for our Fundamentals of Entrepreneurship and Innovation
course. The course just involved designing a framework for a potential business, but we decided to go
ahead and build the actual product - this website!
