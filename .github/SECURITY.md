# Security Policy

Firstly, thanks for helping make MedDex website safe for everyone!

If you believe you have found a vulnerability in the MedDex website, please report it to us as
described below.

<details>

<summary>How do I know I have found a vulnerability?</summary>

Ask yourself these questions:

- Can I access something I should not have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?
- Can I change the functionality of the website?

If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, you are probably dealing with a vulnerability.
Even if you answered 'no' to all questions, you might still be dealing with a vulnerability.
If you are unsure, email [ani@anipalur.com].
